<b>Open Asset Repatriation System (OARS)</b>

New America is working with the U.S. Departments of State and Justice to develop an open source asset repatriation platform. We are beginning to develop an open source clickable prototype of the solution that will be completed in fall 2020. This repo will contain that code. Our technology partner on this project is R3. For more information on this or other Digital Impact and Governance Initiative (DIGI) projects at New America, please email DIGI@newamerica.org.
